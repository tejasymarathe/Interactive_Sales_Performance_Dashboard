Problem Statement:

A small company Axon, which is a retailer selling classic cars, is facing issues in managing and analyzing their sales data. The sales team is struggling to make sense of the data and they do not have a centralized system to manage and analyze the data.

The goal of the project is to design and implement a BI solution using PowerBI and SQL that can help the company manage and analyze their sales data effectively.
