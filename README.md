![Alt text](image.jpeg)


## Problem Statement

Axon, a small retailer specializing in classic cars, is experiencing difficulties in managing and analyzing their sales data. The sales team is struggling to interpret the data without a centralized system, leading to challenges in generating accurate and up-to-date sales reports. This issue is significantly impacting the management's decision-making process.

To address these challenges, Axon has decided to implement a Business Intelligence (BI) solution using Microsoft Power BI and SQL. The goal of this project is to design and implement a BI solution that will help Axon manage and analyze their sales data more effectively.

## MySQL Sample Database Schema

The MySQL sample database schema for this project consists of the following 8 tables:

- **Customers**: Stores customer data.
- **Products**: Stores a list of scale model cars.
- **ProductLines**: Stores a list of product line categories.
- **Orders**: Stores sales orders placed by customers.
- **OrderDetails**: Stores sales order line items for each sales order.
- **Payments**: Stores payments made by customers based on their accounts.
- **Employees**: Stores all employee information and the organizational structure (e.g., who reports to whom).
- **Offices**: Stores sales office data.

## Tools and Technologies

To extract, clean, analyze sales data, and build interactive dashboards and reports, the following tools and technologies will be used:

- **Microsoft Power BI**: [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- **SQL**: [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

These tools are widely used in the field of Business Intelligence (BI) and are well-suited for solving various data-related problems.

## Deliverables

1. **Documented Report**: A comprehensive report in Word or PDF format detailing the project process, findings, and insights.
2. **SQL Files**: Scripts used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
3. **Power BI Report**: An interactive Power BI report/dashboard providing visual insights into the sales data.
